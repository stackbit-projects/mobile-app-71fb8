      We are a team of productivity nuts that love to get stuff done without the
      stress of time management. We work together to optimize workflows,
      understand use cases and set up our app to be the most productive and
      useful tool for us, internally, and for you.




      ## Work Life Balance


      Our goal is for work and life to be controlled in one place, to help you
      maintain a zen state of mind.


      > "Tasks and deadlines should not control our time. We should control what
      when to pay attention to which task." -- Lorinda Mamo, Designer


      With App Land, we strive to make it clear and easy to follow a healthy
      routine of work effectiveness, collaboration, and also family time and
      social events.




      ## We value your YOU time


      Our team understands that life is a marathon, and it's super important to
      make sure you take care of YOU and your needs. This is why we try to
      remind our users to take time off, reward themselves after a job well
      done, and put down the phone every once in a while when there's nowhere
      you have to be, or nothing you need to do.
